# Traffic-Control
In this programming project, I created a system to manage traffic lights at an intersection using semaphore and pthread (a type of threading). The goal is to make sure cars move safely through the intersection by coordinating the timing of traffic lights and the actions of each vehicle. 
Test out the code: you need a C/C++ development environment, preferably in the Ubuntu operating system.
Upon running the program, it will simulate the behavior of traffic lights and vehicles at the intersection. The simulation will run for a predetermined duration, showcasing the coordination between traffic lights and vehicles. Debug messages will be displayed at crucial moments such as vehicle arrival, crossing, and exit.
